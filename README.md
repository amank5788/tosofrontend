# ReactJS-ToDoList
## Introduction
This project implements the Front-End for a simple To-Do List web application, using the React JS library, and also Styled Components along with express server with mongodb as database.so basically it is a full-fledged web app<br/>
It includes the login page and the general UI of the app. <br/>
The login authentication logic and the tasks database for each user is implemented

## Demonstration

## Functionalities
• Login page, sign up page ready to authanticate, which redirects to the main application; <br/>
• Application UI with navigation sidebar and area for the to-do list; <br/>
• Add new task, setting name and categorie properties with different colours; <br/>
• Delete task, with a modal for confirming the action; <br/>
• Check task as done via checkbox; <br/>
• Authorization: user cannot access home page before login, neither login page after logged. <br/>

Obs.: currently, the "filter" and due date  functionalities are not implemented, since I considered it wouldn't contribute that much to my personal learning, and would be very time consuming. Maybe I'll implement this later on.

## Usage

1. Install Node on your machine, via https://nodejs.org/en/.
2. Install npm on your machine via terminal command:  npm install 
3. Install Git on your machine, via https://git-scm.com/downloads.
4. Clone this repository to your machine. (more on how to do this [here](https://github.com/amank5788/todoapp))
5. Run yarn install on the terminal, inside the folder where you downloaded the project, to install all used dependencies.
6. Run npm start to run the project on your browser.







# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
